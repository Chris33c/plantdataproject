This was a project I did for fun to explore the ways I can use the Python Pandas libraries. I used Pandas and Seaborn in this project to explore correlations as well as create a timeseries graph to try and draw a conclusion about the plant data.
The plant data used in this project was pulled from Kaggle.com. I do not own the data.
